# Waste-management-system

GarbageGo is a smart waste management system aimed at optimizing and modernizing the way waste is collected and handled using web technologies. Built using **Node.js** for the backend and **EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates)** for dynamic HTML rendering, the application structures its code with controllers, middleware, and utility functions for clean and scalable development. It also uses **CSS** for styling the user interface and **JavaScript** across both server and client sides. The system likely includes features like user authentication, waste collection scheduling, route optimization, and community reporting tools. Its modular design—featuring clearly defined routes, public static files, and environment configuration—makes it adaptable for municipal use or smart city initiatives. Though the repository currently lacks detailed documentation, the underlying architecture shows promise for creating efficient and sustainable waste management solutions.
